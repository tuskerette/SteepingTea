# Steeping Tea (Original version - now offline)

### Live app
No longer relevant. Kept for historical purposes. Was replaced by stteping-tea-2:

User authentication: Devise.


### About Steeping Tea
This app is for you, if like me, forget your teabag steeping in
hot water for too long, ruining your afternoon tea...
Now you can save your favorite songs from youtube,
then pick the type of tea you are steeping.
Play and enjoy the song.
When the song is done, your tea is ready!
GREAT, isn't it?


### Dev notes
Compile assets locally
`./bin/webpack-dev-server`

then run the rails server.
